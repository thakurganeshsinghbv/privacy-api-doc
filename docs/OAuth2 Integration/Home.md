# OAuth2 Integration

The Bazaarvoice Privacy API provides 2-legged and 3-legged methods for OAuth2 authentication. Use the 2-legged workflow if you want to authenticate your application without a Bazaarvoice Portal user involved in supplying credentials. Use the 3-legged workflow if you want to authenticate your application based on a Bazaarvoice Portal user supplying credentials. Due to its automation advantages, Bazaarvoice expects that the 2-legged workflow best fits the majority of client use cases for the Privacy API.
